#goodcrypto_mail - GoodCrypto Mail

GoodCrypto Mail provides automatic GPG with P2P public key distribution for groups.


##Introduction

GoodCrypto Mail keeps the content of your mail private. It is safe from prying eyes. Think of it as an envelope for your email.

GoodCrypto Mail protects mail during delivery. Your mail is protected between GoodCrypto mail servers with PGP, and from the mail server to the user with SSL. Someone might possibly read your mail before it is sent, or after it arrives. But that's a lot harder, so it's rare.



##Dependencies
